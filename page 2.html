		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Patrick O'Callaghan.  I've been
editing videos for a couple of years now and 
would really like to do so as a career.  I've used
quite a few programs to do so. I started with
DaVinci Resolve then I worked with Vegas Pro.
I worked with Vegas for a majority of my time,
but now I've switched to Premiere Pro and 
After Effects.  Also for the past few months I've
been trying my hand at some 3D work in 
Cinema 4D since it is integrated into After Effects.
You can find some of my 3D renders in the work section.</p>
